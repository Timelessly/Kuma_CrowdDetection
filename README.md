# Summary
The application advises train passengers on which part of the train have less passengers so that passengers can have a more comfortable journey while efficiently utilising the spaces on the train. The application counts passengers by processing images taken from the raspberry pi and contains sensor to find out the temperature/humidity of the train. Passengers can view the status of the through LEDs representing each train car or through a Telegram bot. If required, the administrator can manually trigger a message on the LCD display to advise passengers to move to a certain train car. Administrators can also see the general emotion of the passengers for each train car.
